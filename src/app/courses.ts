In this course, we will understand data as a science as well as look at case studies involving real world data to understand how machine learning models can be created. We will go in depth in predictive modelling, sentiment analysis, user clustering, deep learning and various other topics which are invariably important to understand machine learning, in parallel creating a strong background for data science.
